	abstract = {We propose a novel method for analyzing and visualizing the complexity of standard reinforcement learning ({RL}) benchmarks based on score distributions. A large number of policy networks are generated by randomly guessing their parameters, and then evaluated on the benchmark task; the study of their aggregated results provide insights into the benchmark complexity. Our method guarantees objectivity of evaluation by sidestepping learning altogether: the policy network parameters are generated using Random Weight Guessing ({RWG}), making our method agnostic to (i) the classic {RL} setup, (ii) any learning algorithm, and (iii) hyperparameter tuning. We show that this approach isolates the environment complexity, highlights specific types of challenges, and provides a proper foundation for the statistical analysis of the task's difficulty. We test our approach on a variety of classic control benchmarks from the {OpenAI} Gym, where we show that small untrained networks can provide a robust baseline for a variety of tasks. The networks generated often show good performance even without gradual learning, incidentally highlighting the triviality of a few popular benchmarks.},
