	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

	Abstract = {We present a review of the use of diode lasers in atomic physics with an extensive list of references. We discuss the relevant characteristics of diode lasers and explain how to purchase and use them. We also review the various techniques that have been used to control and narrow the spectral outputs of diode lasers. Finally we present a number of examples illustrating the use of diode lasers in atomic physics experiments. Review of Scientific Instruments is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.},

		abstract = {We propose a novel method for analyzing and visualizing the complexity of standard reinforcement learning ({RL}) benchmarks based on score distributions. A large number of policy networks are generated by randomly guessing their parameters, and then evaluated on the benchmark task; the study of their aggregated results provide insights into the benchmark complexity. Our method guarantees objectivity of evaluation by sidestepping learning altogether: the policy network parameters are generated using Random Weight Guessing ({RWG}), making our method agnostic to (i) the classic {RL} setup, (ii) any learning algorithm, and (iii) hyperparameter tuning. We show that this approach isolates the environment complexity, highlights specific types of challenges, and provides a proper foundation for the statistical analysis of the task's difficulty. We test our approach on a variety of classic control benchmarks from the {OpenAI} Gym, where we show that small untrained networks can provide a robust baseline for a variety of tasks. The networks generated often show good performance even without gradual learning, incidentally highlighting the triviality of a few popular benchmarks.},
