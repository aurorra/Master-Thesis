\section{Conclusion}
- Summarize the thesis, this time with a focus on the results obtained \\
- Add what deductions you have from the discussion above \\ \\
In this work, I delivered a direct comparison of neural networks to the polynomial and binary tree models. I was able to show that especially the binary tree model can deliver comparable results with a simpler structure and less needed parameters. The last aspect makes the process of parameter tuning straightforward.

\todo[inline]{Explain more. Answer research questions.}

\section{Future Work}
- Future work \\
  - Fourier? You should add your own ideas rather than mine :) \\
  - Particularly, please do not mention Bezier yet :) that was in confidence \\
  - Harder benchmarks \\
  - Ways to complexify the function from the b-tree \\ \\
The continuation of this work includes...
