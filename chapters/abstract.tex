Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has been used in many areas, including Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike Deep Learning approaches, BBO techniques do not require additional information about the problem structure. Calculating an accurate gradient in RL problems is usually non-trivial but required for the usage of Deep Learning. In BBO this step is obsolete, which gives us more flexibility overall and more efficiency in the evaluation process. In addition, in BBO it is easy to distribute the computation for parallel computing. With the flexibility BBO offers us, we can choose an arbitrary model. In this thesis, I looked into the Fourier series, BÃ©zier curve, and Taylor approximations.
