First, I want to thank my supervisor Dr. Giuseppe Cuccu for his incredible support throughout this thesis. Whenever I had a problem or a question concerning my research or writing, he took the time to help me and never failed to encourage me. Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Philippe Cudr√©-Mauroux for allowing me to do my thesis at the eXascale Infolab. Gaining insights into the research areas of his team has been an exceptional experience.

Finally, I am sincerely grateful for the support and encouragement of my family during this thesis and my master's studies in general.
